### Changes

- *Bigger recipe icons*
 
 > Scale recipe icon in alt-mode according to the machine's size to better fit PY's enormous machines

- *Tech integrity check*
 
 > Recursively add science packs to technologies that depend on previous techs with more science-packs ingredients
 (i.e. artillery turrets tech, unlocked after military & chemical, will also cost chemical science packs in addition to already present red/green/military)
